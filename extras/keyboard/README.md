# What is this?

These files are for making my myriad keyboards function similarly to one another in an effort to limit the amount of context switching I have to do.

## pok3r-esque.dat

This is for custom or modded keyboards that support the EasyAVR firmware.
The layout in here more or less emulates a Pok3r and has its boot mode binding set as Fn+R-ALT+Shift+Esc, L-CTRL as Fn, and Capslock replaced with L-CTRL

## karabiner.json

This karabiner configuration should go into ~/.config/karabiner/
It maps the capslock as ctrl, left ctrl as a fn, and otherwise uses a pok3r layout.
